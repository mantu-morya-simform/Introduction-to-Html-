          ReactJS is one of the most powerful and widely used JavaScript
          libraries for building modern user interfaces. When I started learning
          React while working on projects, I faced quite a few roadblocks. But
          with persistence, I found solutions that made my learning experience
          much smoother.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In this article, I’ll share the challenges I faced, how I tackled
          them, and a simple roadmap for beginners who want to get started with
          ReactJS efficiently. If you’re new to React or struggling with some
          concepts, this might help you!

        <h2>Challenges & How I Overcame Them</h2>
        <h3>1 : Wrapping My Head Around JSX & Component-Based Architecture</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The Struggle:</strong> Coming from traditional HTML, JSX
            felt weird at first. It looked like HTML, but it wasn’t. The mix of
            JavaScript inside what looked like HTML tags was confusing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> I broke down JSX syntax and reminded
            myself that it’s just JavaScript under the hood. Converting small
            HTML snippets into JSX manually helped me adjust to the syntax
            faster.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2 : Managing State & Props Without Losing My Mind</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The Struggle:</strong> useState and passing data between
            components using props felt tricky. I kept wondering, “Why can’t I
            just use global variables?”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> Building small projects, like a counter
            app, helped me get comfortable with state. The concept of lifting
            state up finally clicked when I tried to pass data from a child
            component to its parent.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3 : Making API Calls & Handling Data Asynchronously</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The Struggle:</strong> Fetching data using useEffect was
            overwhelming at first. I wasn’t sure how to handle async operations
            properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> I started with simple fetch calls before
            moving on to axios. Breaking useEffect into small, focused use cases
            helped me understand it better. Once I learned how dependency arrays
            worked, it all made sense!
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4 : Navigating Without Page Reloads (React Router)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The Struggle:</strong> I was used to traditional
            <a href="page.html"></a> navigation, so implementing routes in React
            felt unfamiliar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> Learning react-router-dom step by step
            helped. I started with simple navigation between Home and About
            pages before moving on to dynamic routes and nested routing.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5 : Styling Components Like a Pro</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The Struggle:</strong> I was used to traditional CSS, so
            using CSS modules or styled-components felt foreign.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> I practiced with CSS modules first, then
            moved on to styled-components. I found that using CSS-in-JS
            libraries made styling more manageable and component-specific.
          </li>
        </ul>
